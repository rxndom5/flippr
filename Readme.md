# Budget App

**Budget App** is a full-stack personal finance application designed to help users manage their budgets, track transactions, set savings goals, earn achievements, and receive insightful notifications. Built with a Flask backend and a React frontend, it leverages a MySQL database for data persistence and Grok AI (via Groq API) for transaction categorization and financial insights. This project was developed for a hackathon, emphasizing user-friendly design and real-time financial tracking.

    - Savings: Milestone reached (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%).
    - Insight: High spending in a category (>50% of total expenses).
    - Creation: New budget or goal.
- **View Notifications**:
  - Endpoint: `GET /notifications`
  - Frontend: Displays in a right-sidebar `Drawer` (via `BellIcon`) and `/notifications` page.
  - UI: Teal cards for unread, gray for read, grouped by date, with badges (e.g., red for `budget`, green for `savings`).

### 6. Achievements
- **Earn Achievements**: Gamifies financial habits with awards.
  - Endpoint: `GET /achievements`

    - **Budget Master**: Stay within budgets for 3 months (Icon: `CheckIcon`).
    - **Consistent Planner**: Log in daily for 7 days (Icon: `CalendarIcon`).
  - Logic: Prevents duplicate awards, stored with `name`, `description`, `icon`, `earned_at`.

### 7. Transaction Reports

    - AI Insights: Grok-generated advice (e.g., "Reduce Food spending").
  - Notifications: Alerts if one category dominates expenses (>50%).
  - Achievements: Awards "Budget Master" for consistent budget adherence.

### 8. AI Integration
- **Transaction Categorization**:
  - Uses Groq API (`llama3-70b-8192`) to assign categories based on descriptions.
